Created a scene in webGL where camera is at the origin looking down the â€“ z-axis.
Created four cubes in the scene. One cube is in front of the camera, one on
its left, one on its right and the last behind the camera. Implemented event
handling through which:
<ul>
<li>a. user can rotate the camera about y-axis. //left and right arrow keys & 'a' and 'd' keys.</li>
<li>b. user can rotate the camera about x-axis. //up and down arrow keys & 'w' and 's' keys. </li>
<li>c. User can rotate all the four cubes about z axis. // 'q' and 'e' keys </li>
</ul>
